They reduce short-term noise and emphasize trends that exhibit consistency, stability, and persistence across market cycles.

## UI Access

Persistent trends are available in the ForecastOS UI, where users can compare persistent and raw trends, visualize long-run narratives, and evaluate trend durability through time.
