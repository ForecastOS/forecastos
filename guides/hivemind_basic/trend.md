<h1>Hivemind: Trends</h1>

## What Are Hivemind Trends?

Hivemind trends are point-in-time measurements of how frequently and how strongly specific macro, thematic, or narrative concepts appear in aggregated discussion.

They quantify evolving focus on ideas such as inflation, AI, geopolitics, regulations, etc.

Trends update continuously and are designed to capture drivers of risk and return that are not well explained by traditional style or factor models.

## UI Access

Hivemind Trends can be explored directly in the ForecastOS UI, where users can browse trend histories, compare trends over time, and inspect how narratives evolve across market regimes.
