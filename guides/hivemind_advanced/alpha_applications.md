<h1>Hivemind: Alpha Applications</h1>

## Overview

Hivemind supports alpha generation by producing point-in-time signals from unstructured, narrative-driven data that explains incremental out-of-sample variance beyond traditional factors.

Hivemind exposures:

- Capture emergent themes early
- Are relatively uncorrelated with momentum
- Exhibit enough stability and persistence to be used systematically
- Are interpretable

In alpha workflows, Hivemind is most commonly used to build thematic tilts, cross-sectional signals, and dynamic overlays that complement conventional quantitative strategies.
