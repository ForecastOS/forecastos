<h1>Hivemind: Creating a Hivemind Overlay</h1>

## Overview

Using point in time Hivemind trend rankings and company level exposures, you can systematically tilt weights toward companies that benefit from active macro, thematic, or other regimes, and away from those that do not.

Overlays can be driven by political regimes, inflation environments, dominant market narratives like AI, or any custom concept. They are easy to implement, low turnover, and portable across long only, long short, and long extension strategies. 

In the below demo strategy, three simple overlays produced roughly 2.5 percent annualized excess return with an information ratio near 1.0 and minimal implementation cost.
