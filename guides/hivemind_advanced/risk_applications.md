<h1>Hivemind: Risk Applications</h1>

## Overview

ForecastOS Hivemind enables **forward-looking risk analysis** by measuring exposure to *emergent, narrative-driven market forces*, like inflation, AI, geopolitics, etc., that are largely invisible to traditional factor models.

Our research shows Hivemind exposures:

* **Explain incremental out-of-sample variance** beyond standard risk factors, demonstrating that they capture *orthogonal sources of risk* rather than repackaged style effects.
* Exhibit **meaningful temporal stability**, allowing them to be used reliably in portfolio-level risk attribution and monitoring.
* Provide **point-in-time exposure estimates**.

In practice, this allows investors to identify *hidden concentrations*, understand *why portfolios behave the way they do*, and stress-test portfolios against evolving macro-narratives rather than traditional style factors.
